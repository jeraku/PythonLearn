Based on the workshop content, here are the main steps, tools, and techniques demonstrated:

CORE PROMPTING TECHNIQUE:
Magic Prompt Formula with 3 components:

Role - Define what AI should act as (e.g., "You are an experienced email copywriter")
Task - What you want AI to do
Instructions - Additional context about audience, style, requirements
TOOLS AND WORKFLOWS DEMONSTRATED:

GetMulti (multi) - Compare responses from multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama, etc.) simultaneously

Perplexity AI - Research tool that reads hundreds of articles and creates comprehensive reports. Use "Research" mode for deep analysis.

Gemini Deep Research - Similar research capability, shows sources and thought process

Grok (by Twitter/X) - Research viral tweets and trending content, especially good for finding new AI tools going viral

Numerous AI - Chrome extension for Google Sheets that:

Generates Excel formulas automatically
Can analyze data within cells using =NAI() function
No need to remember complex formulas
Claude - Upload CSV/Excel files for data analysis. It writes Python code automatically and creates dashboards with visualizations

Gemini Canvas - Create presentations from research. Can export to Google Slides with custom brand colors

Emily (MLE) - Chrome extension that:

Summarizes any webpage or article
Watches YouTube videos and summarizes them
Allows chatting with content in multiple languages
Can answer questions about the content
Notebook LM (by Google) - Learning tool that:

Imports multiple sources (PDFs, websites, YouTube videos)
Creates audio podcasts in 200+ languages
Generates video overviews with slides
Creates quizzes, flashcards, mind maps
Allows joining the AI podcast to ask questions
Fort AI - Product image generation:

Upload Amazon URLs or product images
Creates professional product ads automatically



Generative AI Workshop - Detailed Summary
Overview
This was a comprehensive 2+ hour workshop on Generative AI conducted by Webhav Sasinti, founder of Growth School, teaching participants how to leverage AI tools effectively across various functions.

Core Concepts Taught
1. Prompt Engineering
Magic Prompt Formula: Role + Task + Instructions + Context
Example: Instead of "write an email," specify role (experienced email copywriter), task (write launch email), instructions (make it fun, target 25+ audience, use brand colors)
Result: 10x better outputs compared to basic prompts
Chain Prompting: Breaking complex tasks into sequential prompts for better results
2. Multi-Model AI Usage
Tool: GetMulti (multi.ai)
Allows querying multiple AI models simultaneously (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama, etc.)
Benefits: Compare outputs, choose best response, don't rely on single AI
Helpful for: Getting diverse perspectives and optimal answers
