ollama - for running the model
chromadb - vector db

direct search  -> In DB -> "select * from employee where name = 'jegan'"
semantic search -> In DB -> "select * from employe  where name = 'jega*'"

Example= Rice vs arisi

input - text file -> Number -> graph 

Eucledean distance -> based on the pythagores theorem -> square root of (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2
Manhattan distance -> (x2-x1) + (y2-y1)
Cosine similarity ->  from x0 - draw a line between two points which will result cos0

emdedding - assign the value number in the graphical structure

its an LLM model stores the infomration like rice and arisi - someone already stored and confirmed the values are same.


Vector DB are all supported this embedding only.

One hard encoding -> 

donot call someone more than twice
donot be more friendly without necessarily
donot give knowledge without being asked.
Talk less be secretive
