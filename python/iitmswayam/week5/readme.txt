inferrential statistics



inferrential statisitics-> Claim (hypothesis) -> Mobile manufacture promisiong 96% battery life. how they tested it.
Ex: Car dealer age 30-35  who to pay attention to > how he measured it age is 30-35 person will buy a car.

how they confirmed- is find the average of n number of batteries and show case the average value of it.


population - Sampling used for finding the average 
mew = average 
pi =  claim 10% of batter willl fail. % of time failure will occured
sigma square - variance 

sample statistics. 
X bar -> Mew - claim -> sample of (N)
P hat -> proportion of the sample
s square - variance in sample 

method of sample and size of sample is important to inference.
suggested method is random sampling method.

Sampling distribution

population N=5 
[1,2,3,7,9]: mean mew = 5,  variance sigma square = 8

Sampling distribution - proportion
#toss of a coin  2^5 = 32 possibilities
pr(H) = p = 0.5 
pr(T) = q = 0.5
toss 5 times 

binomial distribution function.
p(x) = c(n,x) p^x * q^n-x 

if n>30
mew = np
sigma square = npq

Binomial distribution vs nominal distribution

================
confidence interval
>> point and range estimates
point estimates> mobile - 96 hours brattery life. sample = 94 hrs = Mew
x bar = mew + root of 1.96 * sigma / square root of n

Range estimate



=================================================
hypothesis testing 

hypothesis meaning > based on knowledge giving confidence based on the existing work.
basis of reasoninig without knowing the truth.

statement of hypothesis usally expressed as Null and alternate hypothesis. > Ex: battery life is 96 hrs or not an 96 hrs
