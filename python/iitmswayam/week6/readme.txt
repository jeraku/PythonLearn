Linear algebra

matrices

rows sample (Data points)
column variable (Attributes)

>> identification of independent attributes 
    all variables are independent so that information is measured
    Rank of matrix refers to the number of linearly independent rows or columns 
    dependent variable as a function of independent variable
    indepedent varialbe is less than dependent variable.
>> identification of linear relationship among attributes
    Null space or nullity will discribe the linear relationship

Rank nullity theorem
    nullity of A  + Rank of A = Total number of attribtues of a

Data matrix = > Null space (collection of vector satisfying AB=0) => Nullity 

m=n 
concept of rank:
a(M*N)
row = data = samples are independent - M 
N - column variable 

m=N (2*2) matrix
row = column 
x=A^-1 b a inverse b
