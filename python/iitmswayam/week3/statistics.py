Types of data (Stevens classification)
  ---> Nominal > Categorical, non mertic, qualitative 
        > property has description but does not have order, distance, origin (Ex: Jersey, Platform)
        > Description: output will be like %
        > Inferntial : chi-square, binominal 
  ---> Ordinal > Categorical, non mertic, qualitative (one is superior to another)
        > property has description, order does not have distance and origin (ex: who won 1st in game and order of grocery price)
        > output will be like percentile or mean
        > inferntial: Rank order correlation, anova 
  ---> Interval > continuous, metric, quantitative
        > property has description, order, distance does not have origin (Ex: Survey, Thermometer)
        > output will be like standard deviation, mean, range
        > Inferential: product movement
  ---> Ratio > continuous, metric, quantitative
        > property has description, order, distance and origin (Ex: curreny, train coach length, weight compare)
        > output will be like a geometric mean, harmonic mean (Ex: CAGR, Train distance)
        > Inferntial: coefficient of variation

Ex:
Km run, price, power output - Ratio data
year of registration - Interval data  (mathemeitcal is of no use)
vehich type, gear box, damage  - Nominal data
Oridnal data: one is superior to another.

Day 2 statistics: 
single variable
    > Measure of Location (Also called Central Tendency)
    > Spread of data (Also called variability)
    > Shape of data (Also called distribution)

Measuere of Location
    Mean - Average of the car price.  (Sum/total) -> Value may differ, so issue in data may occur
    Median - central value (Mid value is defined as median) 
    Mode - Most frequently occuring data (Same car sold in same price twice) amount with % values is returned.


    Nominal - Mode
    Ordinal - Median
    Interval/Ration (No Skew - Price of car is high) - Mean
    Interval/Ration (Skew - Price of car is high) - Median


    Range  -> maximum vaule - minimum value
    Variance -> how each data point is away from central measure - Formula is there 
    Standard Deviation -> Square root of variance -> on an average how the data point is occurs 
    Inter Quartile Range -> Box plot -> split data in 4 quartile. 
        > Find quartiles(Q1, Q2, Q3) miniumum, and max value in range
        > Box is between Q1 & Q3, whiskers is between the min and max values.

Shape of Data
    > Histogram
    > Probability Plot

    

Day 3 > statistics 
    Measure of Association
        > Covariance - is unbounded and also depends on the unit of data
        > Correlation - Scatter plot - indicate the positive or negative impact. starts from -1.
          -Positive correlation, negative correlation, no correlation

          
Metrics to be measured for all
count
minimum
Q1 (25%)
Q2(median) )(50%)
Mean 
Q3
Maximum
standard deviation
cardinality - no. of distinct values
