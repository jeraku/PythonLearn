### 🧠 Core OOP Concepts in Python

1. **Class**
   - Blueprint for creating objects.
   - Defines attributes and methods.

2. **Object**
   - Instance of a class.
   - Has its own state and behavior.

3. **Encapsulation**
   - Bundling data and methods within a class.
   - Restricts direct access to some components using access modifiers (`_protected`, `__private`).

4. **Abstraction**
   - Hides complex implementation details.
   - Focuses on essential features.
   - Achieved using abstract base classes (`abc` module).

5. **Inheritance**
   - Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
   - Promotes code reuse.
   - Supports single, multiple, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.

6. **Polymorphism**
   - Ability to take many forms.
   - Methods can behave differently based on the object calling them.
   - Achieved via method overriding and operator overloading.

7. **Constructor (`__init__`)**
   - Special method used to initialize objects.
   - Automatically called when an object is created.

8. **Destructor (`__del__`)**
   - Special method called when an object is deleted.
   - Used for cleanup tasks.

9. **Method Overloading**
   - Python does not support traditional method overloading.
   - Can be mimicked using default arguments or variable-length arguments.

10. **Method Overriding**
    - Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.

11. **Operator Overloading**
    - Customize behavior of operators (`+`, `-`, `==`, etc.) using special methods like `__add__`, `__eq__`.

12. **Data Hiding**
    - Prevents access to internal object details.
    - Achieved using private variables (`__varname`).

13. **`self` Keyword**
    - Refers to the current instance of the class.
    - Used to access variables and methods within the class.
